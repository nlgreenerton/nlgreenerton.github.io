            <p>After graduate school, I finally had the time to travel internationally with friends, starting with a jaunt to Rome then Florence for a wedding but, truth be told, I found Rome disappointing. Who doesn't like Italy? It was hot and crowded, and the food I ate was mediocre. A failure that could have been avoided with proper preparation - never again! I've since made it a point to research restaurants and plan things to do that match my interests. There's so many resources available now; couple that with the fact that now that we all have smartphones with cameras and suddenly I had all the ingredients for my pet project, so here it is.</p>
