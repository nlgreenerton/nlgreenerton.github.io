            <p>Although I was doing experimental research for all of my academic research, it always included some component of computational analysis. At first, I was tracking and analyzing colloidal particle trajectories over tens of thousands of images. I later was solving a system of differential equations to determine the interfacial tension in images of an oil-water interface. Moving forward, it seemed like fully immersing myself into data analysis was an obvious next step, so I took an immersive, project-based course. I later built on my initial projects to make them comprehensive and learn new techniques at the same time. In this section, I have described the thought process and inspiration behind some of my work.
