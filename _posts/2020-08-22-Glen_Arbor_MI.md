With the pandemic putting all international travel on hold, we had to postpone any nascent plans to visit Colombia to 2021. After months of cabin fever, we agreed that someplace nearby (within reasonable driving distance) was doable, following all CDC guidelines and avoiding interacting with others. As with most trips, we prioritized proximity to nature that offered both hiking and water activities. After looking into several nearby vacation destinations e.g., Door County or somewhere in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, the group agreed upon Glen Arbor, Michigan.

### Locale

I hadn't heard of Glen Arbor before, but it is along the western coast of Michigan below the Leelanau Peninsula and just east of the [Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore](https://www.nps.gov/slbe/index.htm). It is one of many picturesque beach towns scattered along the eastern coast of Lake Michigan, boasting a strip of restaurants, wineries, and one of the larger markets in the area. Walking distance to [Cherry Republic](https://cherryrepublic.com/locations/glen-arbor/) for wine, ice cream, and cherry-themed edible gifts certainly didn't hurt. Glen Arbor was the perfect home base for a week - a 20 minute drive from any of the hikes and beaches to visit during the day and we could walk to the grocery in the evenings.

### Activities

True to form, we planned several outdoorsy day trips. Sleeping Bear Dunes offers many well-maintained trails; for detailed information about the trails, check out [Friends of Sleeping Bear Dunes](https://friendsofsleepingbear.org/trails/). None of the hikes were particularly long or difficult, and the trails were well-maintained so no real fear of getting lost. The famed Pierce Stocking scenic drive was open despite ongoing maintenance, but, to be honest, it wasn't a must-see. It would be a nice spot for picnicking but expendable if pressed for time.

A real highlight was the Sleeping Bear Heritage Trail: a 20-mile mostly paved trail that follows the lakeshore. Not being avid bikers ourselves, it was a little daunting at first but really worth the legwork. We followed the trail from Glen Arbor to the dune climb, parking here to partake. Climbing wasn't nearly as difficult as we expected, but we didn't continue beyond the dunes all the way to the lake. We then rode just beyond the dune climb hoping to reach a scenic viewpoint of Glen Lake, but the maps and signage warned of oncoming hilly spots -- rightly so. After 2.5 of these inclined sections, we turned back, defeated.

I'd also highly recommend some water excursions, either on Lake Michigan or one of the inline lakes and rivers. We didn't have enough people to merit renting a boat, and the usual ferry trips to/from Manitou Island were cancelled for the season, but we did a kayak trip down the [Crystal River](https://www.leelanauconservancy.org/naturalarea/crystal-river-natural-area/), starting at the Crystal River trailhead and ending in Glen Arbor. This wasn't quite the lazy river float trip we'd anticipated: not paddling certainly led to collisions with low-hanging branches! Despite that, it was definitely geared towards novice paddlers (which we are) looking to spend several relaxing hours in the water.

No trip to the water is complete without some proper beach sitting. We made several trips to the beach in Empire; the sandy beach here isn't large but also wasn't particularly busy either, plus the added perk of nearby delicious chocolates at [Grocer's Daughter Chocolates](https://www.grocersdaughter.com/). We didn't stop anywhere else in Empire but just walking through town gave us Stars Hollow vibes, pre-stoplight. The only other town we visited was Leland for a trip to [Fishtown](https://www.fishtownmi.org/visit/shops-and-charters/); the smoked fish dip from [Carlson's](http://www.carlsonsfish.com/) would have been worth the trip but then we later found it in our neighborhood market - still worth the purchase though!

It rained our last full day in Glen Arbor, as if we needed an excuse to spend a day wine tasting. The Leelanau Peninsula is replete with [wineries](https://www.lpwines.com/maps/), many of which feature cherry wines, ciders, and spirits in celebration of the patron fruit of the region. We visited four in the Lake Leelanau area but, truthfully, I don't know enough about wine to recommend (or not) any places. It was more about the surroundings and, for that reason, I'd suggest visiting those outside the small town where you can enjoy the sweeping views and imagine that you're at a villa in Tuscany.

### Housing

<a href="/assets/glen_arbor/house.jpg" data-lightbox="glen_arbor" data-title="Rental house"><img class="image float-right travel blog" src="/assets/glen_arbor/house.jpg" /></a>

I almost always use Airbnb for longer group trips because it's fun to cook together and have communal space to relax and hang out. When going to these smaller vacation towns, there are local rental agencies that manage properties, even people who rent out their own vacation homes. These aren't necessarily also listed on Airbnb, though I suppose it takes some faith in humanity to rent directly from a stranger. At least Airbnb has some protection for renters! We were rewarded this time - our home was truly a gem, the property also had free access to bikes and kayaks, and the owner went above and beyond to make our stay memorable.
