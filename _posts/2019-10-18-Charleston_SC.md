### Locale

Charleston - a bachelorette party mecca. Where better for a girls' weekend? Granted, my only frame of reference is Southern Charm, where they lean into the city's reputation for debauchery. It wasn't that kind of celebration, just an excuse for feasting and catching up with old friends. Despite tourism being a booming industry there, it maintains a small city appeal, never seeming busy or crowded - we only had to wait for tables at brunch.

### Activities

There are countless articles describing things to do in and around Charleston, but without a car and in a city with limited public transit, we did not venture beyond city limits. Furthermore, we did not have the best weather for outdoor adventures so the trip became a tour of biscuits, fried foods, and the occasional park to kill time and digest.

The downtown peninsula is small and easy to explore on foot. Downtown is really a relative term here; the high rises and glass condos synonymous with urban areas are absent here. Instead, we delighted in the charming pastel colored row houses on Rainbow Row and marveled at the stately antebellum homes of The Battery. We took typical tourist pictures at the Waterfront Park and avoided the Confederacy supporters at the White Point Garden. We browsed the wares (mostly knickknacks) at the Charleston City Market.

But this trip was truly all about the eats: salty, crispy biscuits with pimento cheese at [Callie's Hot Little Biscuit](https://calliesbiscuits.com/pages/hlb-upper-king), briny oysters at [Rappahannock Oyster Bar](https://www.rroysters.com/restaurants/rappoysterbarchs), and unctuous crab rice at [Hannibal's Kitchen](http://hannibalkitchen.com/), Sometimes drinks came with a view, like at the rooftop bar at [The Vendue](https://www.thevendue.com/charleston-dining/the-rooftop/) and the extremely picturesque [Citrus Club](https://www.thedewberrycharleston.com/drinks-dining). Other times, delicious drinks were paired with surprisingly tasty bread pudding at [Doar Bros](https://www.doarbros.com/). We indulged our collective sweet tooth with pie at [Miller's All Day](https://millersallday.com/) and cupcakes at [Sugar's Bakeshop](http://www.sugarbake.com/). Somehow we still had room for local seafood at [The Grocery](http://www.thegrocerycharleston.com/) and [Leon's](http://leonsoystershop.com/). Even writing it all down now, I'm shocked we ate so much over a long weekend. Everything was delightful but I'm not sure our waistlines would have survived staying any longer.

### Housing

We decided to stay outside the downtown Charleston area for more space and cheaper digs. We got a cute Airbnb in the Avondale area of West Ashley, which was an easy rideshare trip to and from downtown. The area itself would be nice if I lived in Charleston, but we didn't spend much time exploring the area. It was quite residential and not quite pedestrian friendly (infrequent sidewalks and crosswalks across larger roads) though we did walk to the nearby commercial area for coffee at [Highfalutin Coffee Roasters](http://www.highfalutin.coffee/) and brunch at [The Glass Onion](https://www.ilovetheglassonion.com/saturday-brunch.html). The rainy weather combined with the number of food destinations we had planned in the downtown area really limited our ability to explore our immediate surroundings; we could only eat so many meals in a day!
